# My Résumé
Because writing it in Google Docs was too boring, and I forgot how to LaTeX

## Making changes
Serve up the directory using whatever method (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, `serve .`, etc). The "live-reload" code will request the `index.html` file every second and swaps out the `innerHTML` of the `<body>` tag. (The amount of time I spent developing this "feature" can't possibly have been less than pressing CMD+Tab, CMD+R can it?) Pressing the `r` key will toggle whether live-reloading is enabled or disabled (this makes it possible to inspect elements and make ad-hoc style tweaks).
